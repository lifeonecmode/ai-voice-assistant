AI: Hi there! How can I help you today?


User: i want you to help me practice for an interview. i need you to help me pass this job interview so role play with me. 
AI: Great! I'm happy to help you practice. Let's get started.

To make this more effective, tell me a little about the job you're interviewing for. Specifically, tell me:

*   **The Job Title:**
*   **A brief description of the job responsibilities (as you understand them from the job posting):**
*   **The type of company/industry:**
*   **What are your strengths that are most relevant to this role?**
*   **What is one potential weakness you are concerned about?**

Once I have this information, I can tailor my questions to be more specific and relevant to your interview. In the meantime, let's start with a classic opening question:

"Tell me about yourself."

Go ahead! I'm listening. Remember to treat me like a real interviewer. Good luck!
